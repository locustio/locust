class HttpSession(requests.Session):
    """
    Class for performing web requests and holding (session-) cookies between requests (in order
    to be able to log in and out of websites). Each request is logged so that locust can display 
    statistics.
    
    This is a slightly extended version of `python-request <http://python-requests.org>`_'s
    :py:class:`requests.Session` class and mostly this class works exactly the same. However 
    the methods for making requests (get, post, delete, put, head, options, patch, request) 
    can now take a *url* argument that's only the path part of the URL, in which case the host 
    part of the URL will be prepended with the HttpSession.base_url which is normally inherited
    from a Locust class' host property.
    
    Each of the methods for making requests also takes two additional optional arguments which 
    are Locust specific and doesn't exist in python-requests. These are:
    
    :param name: (optional) An argument that can be specified to use as label in Locust's statistics instead of the URL path. 
                 This can be used to group different URL's that are requested into a single entry in Locust's statistics.
    :param catch_response: (optional) Boolean argument that, if set, can be used to make a request return a context manager 
                           to work as argument to a with statement. This will allow the request to be marked as a fail based on the content of the 
                           response, even if the response code is ok (2xx). The opposite also works, one can use catch_response to catch a request
                           and then mark it as successful even if the response code was not (i.e 500 or 404).
