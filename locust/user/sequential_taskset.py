    Works like TaskSet, but task weight is ignored, and all tasks are executed in order. Tasks can
    either be specified by setting the *tasks* attribute to a list of tasks, or by declaring tasks
    as methods using the @task decorator. The order of declaration decides the order of execution.

    It's possible to combine a task list in the *tasks* attribute, with some tasks declared using
    the @task decorator. The order of declaration is respected also in that case.
