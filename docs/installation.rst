Installation
============

Locust is available on PyPI and can be installed through pip or easy_install

::

    pip install locustio

or::

    easy_install locustio

When Locust is installed, a **locust** command should be available in your shell (if you're not using 
virtualenv - which you should - make sure your python script directory is on your path).

To see available options, run::

    locust --help


Installing ZeroMQ
-----------------

If you intend to run Locust distributed across multiple processes/machines, we recommend you to also 
install **pyzmq** and gevent-zeromq::

    pip install pyzmq gevent-zeromq

or::

    easy_install pyzmq gevent-zeromq

Installing Locust on Windows

The easiest way to get Locust running on Windows is to first install pre built binary packages for
gevent (0.13) and greenlet and then follow the above instructions.
